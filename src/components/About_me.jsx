        <p>
          As an electronic technician, I have acquired the ability to detect and
          solve problems in the most efficient way possible, I have a great
          ability to translate a possible problem to reality and solve it, which
          creates an excellent tool to solve problems that have not yet appeared
          or in turn solve existing ones. I have a great ability to understand
          any kind of flow and this helped me a lot to study and acquire
          knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, JS, and have the ability to use frameworks
          such as REACT and Tailwind.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my daily life I love to spend time with my friends and family, I
          love to understand all possible aspects of life, existential questions
          are a great motivation. Learning more and more every day and being
          able to create virtual worlds, design web pages and program them is my
          driving force. I have an enormous adaptability, I love to work in a
          team and above all I love to help others in every possible way.
